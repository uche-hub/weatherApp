# Weather App

A Flutter-based weather application that fetches and displays current weather data for selected Nigerian cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app features a clean architecture, BLoC state management, and a user-friendly interface with a carousel/tab view for weather data, city selection, and current location weather.

## Features
- Select from 15 predefined Nigerian cities to view current weather data.
- Display weather for up to 3 cities in a carousel/tab view.
- Add/remove cities from the carousel with persistence across app restarts.
- Fetch weather data for the user's current location using geolocation.
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns.
- Unit tests for BLoCs, use cases, repositories, and data sources.
- Responsive UI with smooth animations and error handling.

## Architecture

The app follows a **Clean Architecture** approach with **BLoC** for state management, ensuring separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. It is divided into three layers: **Presentation**, **Domain**, and **Data**.

### Architecture Layers

#### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Responsibility**: Handles UI components, user interactions, and state rendering.
- **Components**:
  - **Widgets**: Flutter widgets for the UI (e.g., city selection dropdown, carousel/tab view, current location button).
  - **BLoC**: Manages UI state and events using the `flutter_bloc` package.
    - `WeatherBloc`: Handles weather data fetching and city selection logic.
    - `CityBloc`: Manages the list of cities in the carousel and persistence.
    - `LocationBloc`: Handles geolocation fetching and weather data for the current location.
  - **Screens**:
    - `HomeScreen`: Displays the carousel/tab view with weather data for selected cities.
    - `CitySelectionScreen`: Allows users to add/remove cities from the carousel.
  - **UI Features**:
    - Carousel/tab view for 3 cities' weather data.
    - Dropdown for selecting from 15 predefined Nigerian cities.
    - Button to fetch weather for the current location.
    - Smooth transitions when changing city selections.

#### 2. Domain Layer
- **Responsibility**: Contains business logic, use cases, and entities. Independent of any framework or external services.
- **Components**:
  - **Entities**:
    - `Weather`: Represents weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, description).
    - `City`: Represents a city with name, latitude, and longitude.
    - `Location`: Represents geolocation coordinates (latitude, longitude).
  - **Use Cases**:
    - `GetWeatherForCity`: Fetches weather data for a specific city.
    - `GetWeatherForLocation`: Fetches weather data for the current location.
    - `ManageCities`: Adds/removes cities from the carousel and persists them.
    - `GetCurrentLocation`: Retrieves the device's geolocation.
  - **Repositories (Abstract)**:
    - `WeatherRepository`: Interface for weather data operations.
    - `CityRepository`: Interface for city list persistence.
    - `LocationRepository`: Interface for geolocation operations.

#### 3. Data Layer
- **Responsibility**: Handles data sources, API calls, and persistence.
- **Components**:
  - **Models**: Data transfer objects (DTOs) that map API responses to entities (e.g., `WeatherModel`, `CityModel`).
  - **Data Sources**:
    - **Remote Data Source**: Interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
      - `WeatherApiService`: Makes HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API (using `http` package).
    - **Local Data Source**: Persists selected cities using `shared_preferences` or `hive` for lightweight storage.
      - `CityLocalDataSource`: Saves and retrieves the list of cities in the carousel.
    - **Geolocation Data Source**: Uses the `geolocator` package to fetch the device's current location.
  - **Repositories (Implementation)**:
    - `WeatherRepositoryImpl`: Implements `WeatherRepository` to fetch weather data from the API.
    - `CityRepositoryImpl`: Implements `CityRepository` to manage city persistence.
    - `LocationRepositoryImpl`: Implements `LocationRepository` to handle geolocation.

### Color Theme
The app uses a consistent color theme defined in `lib/core/constants/app_color.dart`. It includes:
- Primary colors (blues for sky, yellows/oranges for sun).
- Background and card colors for light and dark modes.
- Text colors for readability.
- A gradient for weather cards.
- Support for dynamic theme switching based on device brightness.

### Navigation
The app uses the `go_router` package for type-safe navigation. Routes are defined in `lib/core/constants/route.dart`, with path constants in `lib/core/constants/route_path.dart`. Key routes:
- `/`: HomeScreen (displays weather carousel).
- `/city-selection`: CitySelectionScreen (add/remove cities).

### Widgets
The app includes reusable UI components in `lib/features/weather/presentation/widgets/`:
- `header_text.dart`: A customizable widget for displaying titles using Google Fonts' Roboto, with bold styling and theme-aware colors.
- `description_text.dart`: A widget for displaying description text using Google Fonts' Open Sans, with secondary styling, supporting truncation and alignment.
- `custom_toast.dart`: A utility for showing success or failure toast messages with icons, styled with theme-aware colors.
- `horizontal_loader.dart`: A linear progress indicator for button loading states, using the app's primary color.
- `circular_loader.dart`: A clean circular progress indicator for screen or widget loading, with customizable size and stroke width.
- `custom_app_bar.dart`: A transparent app bar with customizable title and actions, using Google Fonts' Roboto.

### State Management
The app uses the BLoC pattern for state management, implemented in `lib/features/weather/presentation/bloc/`:
- `weather_bloc.dart`: Manages fetching and displaying weather data for cities and current location.
- `city_bloc.dart`: Handles adding, removing, and persisting selected cities (up to 3).
- `location_bloc.dart`: Manages fetching the device's current location.
Mock repositories in `lib/features/weather/data/mock_repositories.dart` simulate data fetching and persistence for development.

## âœ… Automated Tests

This project includes a widget test to verify that the `WeatherBloc` correctly loads weather data and updates the UI.

**What it tests:**
- When the app starts, it dispatches `LoadWeather` to the `WeatherBloc`.
- It shows a loader and then displays the default city ("Lagos").
- It displays the weather carousel and the menu icon.
- Tapping the menu shows the **Manage Cities** dialog with the correct available cities.


### Dependencies
- `flutter_bloc`: For state management.
- `http`: For API requests to OpenWeatherMap.
- `geolocator`: For fetching the device's current location.
